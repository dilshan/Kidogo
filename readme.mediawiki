==== Kidogo USB Interface ====

USB interface of the Kidogo system is based around Microchip's PIC18F2550 microcontroller and generate 5V CMOS and TTL compatible outputs. Dimensions of current version of Kidogo USB interface is 53mm x 40mm (using standard through-hole components) and this can be reduce into more by using PCB layout based on SMD components.

Kidogo Player is design to work under the Microsoft Windows operating systems and it has following general features:

* Save waveforms and settings as binary file (KDF file) or export waveform as a text file
* Playback controls such as "Play to segment", "Play from segment", "Step back", "Step next" and "Clear"
* Shifting and rotating waveforms
* Invert, Reset, Clocking and Binary Generator functions
* Copy and Paste waveforms
* Mute function to each individual channel
* Launch without any installation or configuration (design to work as portable Windows application)
