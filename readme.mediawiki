[[File:https://github.com/dilshan/Kidogo/raw/master/Res/kinfo.jpg]]<br/>

Kidogo is 8 channel USB self powered digital signal injector. Kidogo system consists with Signal Editor and USB interface module. [https://github.com/downloads/dilshan/Kidogo/KidogoPlayer10077.zip Kidogo Player] is the Signal Editor of the Kidogo system and it can support up to 512 time slots (each range between 1''ms'' to 1''s'') with 8 channels.

Note: Due to [https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads removal of the Github "downloads section"] we provide another alternative site to download compiled Kidogo binaries. These latest compiled binaries are now available at [http://elect.wikispaces.com/Downloads elect.wikispaces.com].

==== Kidogo USB Interface ====

USB interface of the Kidogo system is based around Microchip's PIC18F2550 microcontroller and generate 5V CMOS and TTL compatible outputs. Dimensions of current version of Kidogo USB interface is 53mm x 40mm (using standard through-hole components) and this can be reduce into more by using PCB layout based on SMD components.

Kidogo Player is design to work under the Microsoft Windows operating systems and it has following general features:

* Save waveforms and settings as binary file (KDF file) or export waveform as a text file
* Playback controls such as "Play to segment", "Play from segment", "Step back", "Step next" and "Clear"
* Shifting and rotating waveforms
* Invert, Reset, Clocking and Binary Generator functions
* Copy and Paste waveforms
* Mute function to each individual channel
* Launch without any installation or configuration (design to work as portable Windows application)
